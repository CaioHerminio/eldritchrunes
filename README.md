<h1>üêô Eldrtich Runes ‚Äì Project 8 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>What if cosmic horror could be used to teach error handling in programming? <strong>Eldritch Runes</strong> is a terminal-based project inspired by Lovecraftian mythos. It plunges the user into a nightmare dimension where only correct incantations can break the curse.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The goal was to design a small ‚Äúpantheon‚Äù of spirits using a class system, each with unique attributes like name, power, immortality, and a poetic description. These spirits are defined as instances of custom classes and printed with styled output to give each one character and personality. This was my introduction to classes, constructors, and encapsulation.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>I created a class structure for magical spirits and implemented an array of them in code, adding expressive formatting to display their profiles. Using <strong>constructors</strong> and <strong>methods</strong>, I defined behavior like the <code>info()</code> method, which reveals a formatted summary of each spirit‚Äôs nature. The output uses emoji and spacing to enhance readability and give a sense of mysticism.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>The result is a creative code grimoire of classes and object instancing. <strong>Succconomicon</strong> proves that code can be both functional and artistic, and that even an OOP exercise can become a digital fantasy experience.</p>

<h2>Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like the first project, this one is being developed in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I‚Äôm studying these three languages simultaneously to avoid becoming too attached to the quirks of just one. This method helps me grasp the core logic of programming ‚Äî which is universal across languages ‚Äî rather than memorizing syntax. By rewriting the same project in multiple languages, I reinforce my understanding of structures, variables, functions, and flow ‚Äî while also appreciating the expressive power of each language.</p>

<h2>Project Scope: Succonomicon</h2>
<p>Core concepts covered (in addition to concepts from previous projects):</p>
<ul>
  <li>OOP</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Fool's Journey is similar to Joseph Campbell‚Äôs famous Hero‚Äôs Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. Here, each project increases in complexity and covered concepts, from simple variables and data types to APIs, Memory Management, Databases and GUI.</p>
